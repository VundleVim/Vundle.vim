# End To End Tests

#### What is this?!?
These are end to end tests written in bash. They need bash, vim and git to be run.
They use real internet connection to download plugins from github, so you cannot run them without it.

#### To run a specific test:
```bash
$ bash test/end2end/nameOfTest.sh
```
